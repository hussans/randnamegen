**Project Name**: Enhanced Random Name Generator
<br/>
**Description**: This desktop app is a simple tool for creating random groups using vanilla JavaScript. Users can add/remove names, pick individuals randomly, and generate groups by specifying either group size or total groups. It prevents single-person groups unless intentionally requested (like for odd numbers). Names save automatically between sessions. Designed for classrooms, team activities, or random draws, it works offline and keeps the interface clean and easy to use.
